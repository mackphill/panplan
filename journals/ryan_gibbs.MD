## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

Today we all worked on getting our migrations in order and getting api end points setup for creating recipes and users.

On my own I worked on getting api end points setup for getting user details and getting a list of all created recipes. I was having some difficulty with creating the individual instances of the recipes after getting all the columns from the SQL tables, but once I started liberally using print statements it went much smoother.
